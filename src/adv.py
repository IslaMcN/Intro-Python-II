# Main
#

# Make a new player object that is currently in the 'outside' room.

# Write a loop that:
#
# * Prints the current room name
# * Prints the current description (the textwrap module might be useful here).
# * Waits for user input and decides what to do.
#
# If the user enters a cardinal direction, attempt to move to the room there.
# Print an error message if the movement isn't allowed.
#
# If the user enters "q", quit the game.

# Step 1: Entering name and beginning game
##DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS \/\/ VVVVVV With your player import crap

print(room['outside'])
# Currently saying "isla" or "i" is not defined but if I put nothing it saying it cannot parse an empty string.
# Takes a name but return room.Room instance is not clean

# Step 2: prompt user to make a choice
# No prompt after telling where player is
